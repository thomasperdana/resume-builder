## Form Component

Built on [React Aria's Form](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/forms.html#forms) component, the [Form](/docs/components/form) component provides accessible form handling with built-in submission, validation and error management.

<Spacer y={4} />

<CodeDemo title="Usage" files={formContent.demo} />

### Built-in Validation

You can use native HTML validation attributes or create custom validation rules.

```tsx
import {Button, Form, Input} from "@heroui/react";

function Example() {
  return (
    <Form validationBehavior="native">
      <Input
        isRequired
        errorMessage="Please enter a valid email"
        label="Email"
        name="email"
        type="email"
      />
      <Button type="submit">Submit</Button>
    </Form>
  );
}
```

<Spacer y={4} />

<CodeDemo title="Usage" showEditor={false} files={formContent.usage} />

### Real-time Validation

You can validate the form data while users are typing.

```tsx
function Example() {
  const [password, setPassword] = React.useState("");
  const errors = [];

  if (password.length < 4) {
    errors.push("Password must be 4 characters or more.");
  }
  if ((password.match(/[A-Z]/g) || []).length < 1) {
    errors.push("Password must include at least 1 upper case letter");
  }
  if ((password.match(/[^a-z]/gi) || []).length < 1) {
    errors.push("Password must include at least 1 symbol.");
  }

  return (
    <Input
      errorMessage={() => (
        <ul>
          {errors.map((error, i) => (
            <li key={i}>{error}</li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      )}
      isInvalid={errors.length > 0}
      label="Password"
      labelPlacement="outside"
      placeholder="Enter your password"
      value={password}
      variant="bordered"
      onValueChange={setPassword}
    />
  );
}
```

<Spacer y={4} />

<CodeDemo title="Real-time Validation" showEditor={false} files={formContent.realTimeValidation} />

### Server Integration

The Form components works seamlessly with React Server Actions.

```tsx
"use client";

import {useActionState} from "react";
import {Button, Form, Input} from "@heroui/react";

export function AddForm() {
  const [{errors}, formAction] = useActionState(createTodo, {
    errors: {},
  });

  return (
    <Form action={formAction} validationErrors={errors}>
      <Input name="todo" label="Task" />
      <Button type="submit">Add</Button>
    </Form>
  );
}
```

### Form Libraries Support

You can also use popular form libraries like `react-hook-form` and `formik`.

```tsx
import {Controller, useForm} from "react-hook-form";
import {Button, Form, Input} from "@heroui/react";

function Example() {
  const {handleSubmit, control} = useForm({
    defaultValues: {
      name: "",
    },
  });

  return (
    <Form onSubmit={handleSubmit((data) => console.log(data))}>
      <Controller
        control={control}
        name="name"
        rules={{required: "Name is required"}}
        render={({field, fieldState}) => (
          <Input
            {...field}
            label="Name"
            isInvalid={fieldState.invalid}
            errorMessage={fieldState.error?.message}
          />
        )}
      />
      <Button type="submit">Submit</Button>
    </Form>
  );
}
```

### Accessibility Built-in

The `Form` component automatically handles ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation, making your forms usable by everyone:

```tsx
function Example() {
  return (
    <Form>
      <Input
        label="Username"
        description="Choose a unique username"
        isRequired
        errorMessage="Username is required"
        // Automatically adds aria-required, aria-invalid, and aria-describedby
      />
      <Input
        label="Password"
        type="password"
        description="Must be at least 8 characters"
        // Help text is automatically linked via aria-describedby
      />
      <Button type="submit">Submit</Button>
    </Form>
  );
}
```

### Schema validation

The `Form` component supports errors from schema validation libraries like [Zod](https://zod.dev/).
You can use Zod's `flatten` method to get error messages for each field and return them as part of the server response.

```tsx {14}
// In your server.
import {z} from "zod";

const schema = z.object({
  name: z.string().min(1),
  age: z.coerce.number().positive(),
});

function handleRequest(formData: FormData) {
  const result = schema.safeParse(Object.fromEntries(formData));

  if (!result.success) {
    return {
      errors: result.error.flatten().fieldErrors,
    };
  }

  // Do something with the validated data.

  return {
    errors: {},
  };
}
```

<Spacer y={4} />

```tsx {13}
// In your client.
import {useFormState} from "react";
import {Button, Form, Input} from "@heroui/react";

import {handleRequest} from "./server";

function Example() {
  const [formState, formAction] = useFormState(handleRequest, {
    errors: {},
  });

  return (
    <Form action={formAction} validationErrors={formState.errors}>
      <Input isRequired label="Name" name="name" />
      <Input isRequired label="Age" name="age" type="number" />
      <Button type="submit">Submit</Button>
    </Form>
  );
}
```

## Input OTP Component

The [Input OTP](/docs/components/input-otp) component provides an accessible way to enter one-time passwords with built-in focus management and keyboard navigation. It is built on top of the [input-otp](https://github.com/guilhermerodz/input-otp) library by [@guilherme_rodz](https://twitter.com/guilherme_rodz).

```tsx
import {Button, InputOtp, Form} from "@heroui/react";

        e.preventDefault();
        const formData = new FormData(e.currentTarget);
        const otp = formData.get("otp");

        setOtp(otp);
      }}
    >
      <InputOtp
        isRequired
        aria-label="OTP input field"
        length={4}
        name="otp"
        placeholder="Enter code"
        validationBehavior="native"
      />
      <Button size="sm" type="submit" variant="bordered">
        Submit
      </Button>
      {otp && <div className="text-small text-default-500">OTP submitted: {otp}</div>}

## Collection-based components Virtualization

[Select](/docs/components/select), [Autocomplete](/docs/components/autocomplete) & [Listbox](/docs/components/listbox) components now support virtualization to improve performance on large collections.

<CodeDemo title="Virtualization" highlightedLines="41" files={autocompleteContent.virtualization} />

> **Note**: The virtualization strategy is based on the [@tanstack/react-virtual](https://tanstack.com/virtual/latest) package, which provides efficient rendering of large lists by only rendering items that are visible in the viewport.

See the [Autocomplete documentation](/docs/components/autocomplete) for more details and examples.

<Spacer y={4} />

## React 19 Support & Library Upgrades

- In preparation for [React 19](https://react.dev/blog/2024/12/05/react-19), NextUI is now compatible with React 19 RC and Next.js 15.
- React Aria packages upgrades and fixes the exact versions of React Aria, React Flow, React Hook Form, React Router, React Server, React Use, Tanstack Query, Tanstack Virtual, and Tanstack Table
- Framer Motion is now **only** added to the final bundle when the animations are enabled and we also added support for [Framer motion v12](https://motion.dev/blog/framer-motion-is-now-independent-introducing-motion)

<Spacer y={4} />

## New use-theme hook

We created our own `use-theme` hook that replaces `use-dark-theme` hook to allow users to change the theme at runtime.

```jsx
// App.tsx or App.jsx
import React from "react";
import {useTheme} from "@heroui/use-theme";

export default function App() {
  const {theme} = useTheme();

  return (
    <main className={`${theme} text-foreground bg-background`}>
      <App />
    </main>
  );
}
```

<Spacer y={4} />

```jsx
// components/ThemeSwitcher.tsx
import {useTheme} from "@heroui/use-theme";

export const ThemeSwitcher = () => {
  const {theme, setTheme} = useTheme();

  return (
    <div>
      The current theme is: {theme}
      <button onClick={() => setTheme("light")}>Light Mode</button>
      <button onClick={() => setTheme("dark")}>Dark Mode</button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

See the [Dark Mode documentation](/docs/customization/dark-mode) for more details and examples.

<Spacer y={4} />

## Draggable Modal

Added support for draggable modals.

<CodeDemo title="Draggable Modal" files={modalContent.draggable} />

<Spacer y={4} />

> **Note**: The modal is draggable only from the header part.

## Router Improvements

NextUI now provides enhanced routing capabilities with better TypeScript support and integration with popular routing solutions:

- **Path Type Safety**: All router-based components now support path intellisense when using TypeScript
- **Router Options Support**: Added `routerOptions` prop to all link components for controlling navigation behavior
- **Enhanced Router Configuration**: Global type configuration for router options through TypeScript:

```tsx
// Example with Next.js App Router
declare module "@react-types/shared" {
  interface RouterConfig {
    routerOptions: NonNullable<Parameters<ReturnType<typeof useRouter>["push"]>[1]>;
  }
}
```

- **Improved Base Path Support**: Better handling of base paths through the new `useHref` prop in `HeroUIProvider`
- **Framework-specific Optimizations**: Built-in support for Next.js (both App and Pages Router), React Router, Remix, and TanStack Router

See the [Routing documentation](/docs/guide/routing) for more details.

<Spacer y={4} />

## API Improvements

### HeroUIProvider

- `useHref` (added) - Converts a router-specific href to a native href for use on DOM elements. For example, if your router accepts relative paths or custom link formats, useHref will generate the full native href based on the RouterProvider's configuration.
- `navigate` (modified) - `((path: Href, routerOptions?: RouterOptions) => void) | undefined` - we added the router options
- `reduceMotion` (added) - Controls the motion preferences for the entire application, allowing developers to respect user settings for reduced motion. The available options are:
  - `"always"` - Always disable motion
  - `"never"` - Always enable motion
  - `"user"` - Respect user system preferences for motion

### DatePicker

- `selectorButtonPlacement` (added) - Controls the placement of selector buttons
- `showMonthAndYearPickers` (added) - Controls visibility of month and year picker dropdowns

### Tabs

- `tabRef` (added) - Allows accessing the underlying tab element via ref

### Popover

- `shouldCloseOnScroll` (added) - Controls whether popover should close when scrolling

### Table

- `isKeyboardNavigationDisabled` (added) - Disables keyboard navigation in tables

### Textarea

- `isClearable` (added) - Adds clear button functionality to textarea

### Select

- `hideEmptyContent` (added) - Controls visibility of empty content message
- Added virtualization support for improved performance with large datasets

### Autocomplete & Listbox

- Added virtualization support for improved performance with large datasets

### Modal

- Added support for draggable modals (draggable from header)

See the [HeroUIProvider documentation](/docs/api-references/nextui-provider) for more details.

## ðŸš¨ Breaking Changes

We try to keep the breaking changes to a minimum, but sometimes it's necessary to make changes to the API to improve the developer experience.

#### Table Theme Group Data Selectors

The nested group selectors for table themes have been updated to require explicit element selectors. You'll need to add `/tr` or `/th` to custom styles for group-data.

```diff-tsx
// Before
- group-data-[disabled=true]:text-foreground-300;

// After
+ group-data-[disabled=true]/tr:text-foreground-300;
```

#### Circular Progress Theme Location

The circular progress Tailwind variants have been moved from `circular-progress` to `progress`. You'll need to update your Tailwind CSS configuration `tailwind.config.js`:

```diff-tsx
// Before
- "./node_modules/@heroui/theme/dist/components/circular-progress.js";

// After
+ "./node_modules/@heroui/theme/dist/components/progress.js";
```
